# Engineering Invariants

Internal engineering contract governing ownership evidence, state transitions,
authorization scopes, transactional boundaries, and API guarantees across Aikito.

This document is the entry point for all engineering invariants. For user-facing
safety documentation, see [Safety Model](../safety.md).

---

## Purpose

Every invariant is identified by a permanent Rule ID stable across refactors and
phases. Invariants serve as implementation and testing specifications; they are
not user documentation.

---

## Status Annotations

- `[current]`: Behavior verified by regression tests and currently active in the codebase.
- `[planned]`: Target contract for Plan / Executor / State Store implementation.
- `[compat-gap]`: Discrepancy between current implementation heuristic and target safety model, documented for alignment.

---

## Common Notation

- $C$: Content fingerprint of the canonical resource in the workspace (`skills/<name>/`).
- $R$: Content fingerprint of the runtime resource in the checkout (`.agents/skills/<name>/`).
- $B$: Baseline fingerprint recorded in the active copy management record at last successful sync.

> **Note**: $B$ is only used by copy-managed Project Skills. Global Skills, Instructions, and Memory runtime visibility are link-only and do not use a content baseline.
