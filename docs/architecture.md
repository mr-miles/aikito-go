# Architecture

Aikito separates a stateless CLI source checkout from a stateful, Git-managed
user workspace. This boundary allows the CLI to evolve without treating user
memory and configuration as application installation files.

## Source and Workspace

The two directories serve different purposes:

```text
~/aikito-src   CLI source checkout
<workspace>    canonical user workspace (defaults to ~/aikito)
```

They must remain separate. The default workspace is `~/aikito`. An explicit
`aikito init workspace <path>` persists another default; `AIKITO_DIR` overrides
it temporarily. Use `aikito path workspace` for machine-readable resolution.

## Canonical Source

The workspace is the source of truth:

```text
<workspace>
├── global/AGENTS.md
├── skills/
├── memory/
├── projects/
├── mcps/
├── agents/
├── skills.toml
└── subagents/
        |
        | aikito sync ...
        v
Agent-native configs + <project>/.agents/
```

Agent configuration directories and project-level `.agents/` directories are
runtime entry points. Do not maintain independent copies there when Aikito owns
the corresponding resource.

## Use or Adapt the Aikito Skill

The complete [Aikito skill](https://github.com/lsaint/aikito/blob/main/src/aikito/templates/skills/aikito/SKILL.md) teaches a coding agent
how to install, configure, and operate an Aikito workspace. Use it as provided
or adapt its workspace layout, Agent registry, synchronization policy, and
review requirements to match your environment.

## Resources

| Resource | Canonical source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Memory | `memory/`, `projects/<name>/memory/` | Durable global and project knowledge |
| Skills | `skills/<name>/` | Reusable Agent workflows |
| Instructions | `global/AGENTS.md`, `projects/<name>/AGENTS.md` | Global and project behavior |
| MCP servers | `mcps/*.toml` | Cross-Agent server definitions |
| Subagents | `subagents/<name>.md` | Cross-Agent specialist definitions |
| Agent registry | `agents/<name>.toml` | Integration paths and supported capabilities |

The bundled `skills/aikito/` and `skills/durable-memory/` directories are
system-managed snapshots whose source is the installed Aikito package. Read-only
inspection commands report divergence. Workspace initialization and global
synchronization back up divergent snapshots under
`~/.aikito/backups/bundled-skills_<timestamp>/` and replace them before
synchronizing Agent runtime targets. Other workspace skills remain
user-managed canonical resources.

Aikito calls the resource “instructions” while retaining the ecosystem-standard
`AGENTS.md` filename for its canonical content.

Integrations are capability-based. An Agent may participate in instructions,
skills, MCP, or subagent synchronization independently. The default registry
contains Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity CLI (`agy`), OpenCode, GitHub Copilot
CLI, DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`), Grok Build, and Pi.

Grok Build uses `~/.grok/rules/aikito.md` for global instructions,
`~/.agents/skills` for shared skills, `~/.grok/config.toml` for MCP servers,
`~/.grok/agents/` for subagents, and root `AGENTS.md` files for project rules.

Pi participates in instructions, skills, and runners. It uses
`~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` for global instructions, `~/.agents/skills` for shared
skills, and root `AGENTS.md` files for project rules. When Pi's optional
`subagent` extension entry point exists, Aikito synchronizes global definitions
to `~/.pi/agent/agents`; without it, the capability is skipped and no target
files are written. Pi has no MCP section and is omitted from MCP
synchronization.

An Agent's `[agents.<name>.mcp]` table supports optional configuration keys:
`name_style` (e.g. `"underscore"` for runtimes requiring snake_case identifiers)
and `builtin_mcps` (a list of Agent-native default server names, such as
`["openaiDeveloperDocs"]` for Codex, that `aikito adopt` automatically omits from
workspace adoption).

### Agent definitions and adapters

Agent TOML declares paths, runner commands, optional capabilities, and portable
installation policy. Core plans and executes capabilities; MCP and Subagent
registries own native rendering, parsing, field validation, and file layouts.
`config_format` selects the semantic adapter. Agents with the same file syntax
can use different adapters when their header or authentication behavior differs.

An optional detection table accepts CLI command names and safe paths relative
to the host's home directory:

```toml
[agents.example.detect]
commands = ["example"]
paths = [".example"]
```

Any command on `PATH` or existing marker counts as installed. Missing detection
metadata in an older built-in definition uses only the bundled detection policy;
other capability fields are never merged. Custom agents without signals use the
target parent directory when available and otherwise remain unknown. Observation
results stay local and are never written into portable resources.

Subagent platform tables resolve through the workspace's Agent definition to
its adapter. Local authoring (`add`, `adopt`, layout migration) rejects unknown
platforms, missing capabilities, and invalid fields before writing. Workspace
resource batches validate only written subagents and those whose platform
definitions changed, against the resulting workspace including Agent
definitions in the same batch; platforms without a definition there stay
portable. Runtime loading and synchronization ignore such platforms and Doctor
reports them as warnings. Shared-file adapters provide text merges; Core still
freezes final content, checks stale plans, protects conflicts, backs up, and
writes atomically.

MCP capabilities may declare an optional `adapter` when one file format carries
different semantics. Grok and Codex both use `config_format = "toml"`; Grok
declares `adapter = "grok_toml"` to keep `${ENV}` headers independent of Codex's
`env_http_headers`. Without `adapter`, the key defaults to `config_format`, and
an older built-in definition whose format still matches its bundled template
inherits only the bundled adapter. Older clients ignore the field, so the
portable definition stays compatible. Subagent formats are already one per
native semantics, so subagent capabilities have no separate adapter key.

## Project Runtime Directory

Project synchronization creates a managed `.agents/` directory in the target
project for skills and memory. Project instructions are linked only to each
workspace-registered agent's configured `project_instruction_path`; paths shared
by multiple agents are created once. Aikito refuses to replace unmanaged content
at any instruction target. Skills use the project's configured
`sync_mode`, which can link or copy them.

### Project Skill Sync Modes

`sync_mode` applies only to project skills under `.agents/skills/`. Project
instructions and memory always remain linked to the Aikito workspace so that
their canonical content has a single source of truth. Selecting `copy` therefore
does not make every managed project resource independent of Aikito or eliminate
all symbolic links.

The two skill modes serve different collaboration models:

| Mode | Runtime representation | Design intent | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `link` | Symbolic links to workspace skills | Keep one live canonical skill shared by projects | Skill content is not stored in the project repository and requires access to the Aikito workspace and symbolic-link support |
| `copy` | Managed copies inside the project | Make selected skill contents reviewable and versionable with the project | Copies can drift from their canonical skills and must be reconciled before synchronization replaces collaborator changes |

Use `link` when the workspace is the authoritative working environment and
projects should immediately see canonical skill updates. Use `copy` when a
project needs a self-contained, Git-trackable snapshot of its selected skills,
for example when collaborators or CI do not share the same Aikito workspace.
Treat copied skills as generated project artifacts. `aikito status` reports
drift and `aikito diff` compares runtime files with their canonical workspace
versions. Make lasting improvements in the canonical skill, or reconcile
project changes back into it before synchronizing again. Synchronization stops
on drift unless `--force` is supplied after review.

Project `.agents/skills/` uses entry-level ownership. Skills not selected by the
project configuration coexist as project-owned entries and appear as notices;
only selected-name collisions are conflicts. A matching directory copy does not
prove Aikito ownership; only provably managed links are removed after
deselection. `.agents/memory/` remains exclusively managed by Aikito.

## Synchronization Behavior

Aikito plans synchronization against the canonical workspace, identifies
managed and unmanaged targets, and stops on conflicts that require user
judgment. Managed-entry fingerprints expose drift rather than silently
replacing local changes.

Use `aikito status` for the aggregate view and the resource-specific status
commands for details. See [Safety model](safety.md) for write boundaries and
recovery expectations.
