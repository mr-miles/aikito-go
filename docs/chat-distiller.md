# Capture Browser Conversations

[Chat Distiller](https://github.com/lsaint/chat-distiller) is Aikito's optional
browser companion. It distills a supported browser AI conversation into concise
Markdown and saves the result directly to a local directory you authorize.

[Chat Distiller](https://github.com/lsaint/chat-distiller) handles capture.
Aikito handles review, scoping, Git history, retrieval, and reuse across
projects, sessions, and coding agents. Neither tool requires the other:
[Chat Distiller](https://github.com/lsaint/chat-distiller) also works with
Obsidian vaults, ordinary Git repositories, and other local Markdown knowledge
bases.

## Recommended Workflow

    A["Browser AI conversation"] -->|"Distill with Chat Distiller"| B["Aikito inbox/"]

    C -->|"Reuse Context"| D
```

1. Install [Chat Distiller](https://github.com/lsaint/chat-distiller) and
   authorize the root of your Aikito workspace.
2. Keep its default save subdirectory as `inbox`.
3. From a supported conversation, run **Generate and save**.
4. Decide the note's path based on your task:
   - **For immediate tasks**: Let a coding agent read notes directly from `inbox/` without committing raw drafts.
   - **For durable knowledge**: Review the Markdown in `inbox/`, correct inaccuracies, and move verified conclusions into `memory/` or `projects/<name>/memory/`.
5. Optionally assign durable memory notes a `category` for custom grouping.
6. Commit verified memory changes with Git.

## What `inbox/` Means

`inbox/` is a gitignored staging area for browser-distilled notes that have not yet been classified or accepted as durable memory.

Its contents serve two complementary purposes:

1. **Immediate task input**: Coding agents and users can inspect notes in `inbox/` directly via `aikito show inbox [target]` to carry out single-session tasks.
2. **Staging for review**: Raw distilled notes remain uncommitted until reviewed, preventing temporary context or unverified ideas from polluting Git history.

Agents should not treat notes remaining inside `inbox/` as established project constraints merely because they exist.

After review for long-term storage:

- put cross-project knowledge in `memory/notes/`;
- put project-specific knowledge in `projects/<name>/memory/notes/`;
- discard transient, unverified, duplicated, or low-value material.

Prefer one stable conclusion per memory note. Agents search the note files
directly. See [Memory workflow](memory-workflow.md)
for the full persistence criteria and [Use Durable Memory](durable-memory.md) for
the operational commands.

## Trust Boundary

[Chat Distiller](https://github.com/lsaint/chat-distiller) writes only to a
directory the user explicitly authorizes. Its generated notes still originate
from an AI response and must be reviewed before they become durable memory. Do
not place credentials, tokens, private keys, or other secrets in `inbox/` or
memory.

The extension currently bundles a ChatGPT adapter. Refer to the
